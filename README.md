Due to the high cost of having Cisco ACI starter fabric $250k+ and Cisco ACI Simulator $10k+(not including the hardware cost)
Cisco DevNet has generously provided Cisco ACI on the Internet for development purposes.

I have created Ansible playbooks to create, get, and remove tenant, epg, vrf and bridge domain to execute
against Cisco DevNets Cisco ACI.

Thanks to Cisco DevNet for keeping the cloud ACI environment available.
